javac - java compiler comes with JDK [convert source code into byte code as well as verify syntax too]
.class - byte code
Java - interpreter
java(jvm will be invoked) is the command interpret byte code
java slogan : Write once excute anywhere (WORA)

-------------------------------------------

jvm[java virtual machine]
virtual machine - machine inside machine
JRE - java runtime environment - run java app
runtime - infrstructure to operate program
JRE include JVM
JDK - Java Development kit - provide tools for app developement

JDK include JRE include JVM
variable - is a memory(Ram) storage which is use to store data

----------------------------------------------
6th

concatination : used in strings to display the output
-> we can use b/w diff datatypes
-> if same datatype like int used by + it will acts as add. [use () with other datatypes]
+ -> ex of polymorphoism

operators : used to modify the data

++ -> increment by 1
-- -> decrement by 1 

shorthand format / compound assignment operator
x = x + 10
x += 10
x *= 10

types:
1.arithmetic operator
2.relational operator/comparison operator[==,!=,>,<  ]
3.logical operator  [&&,||,!]
4.bitwise operator [&(both bits are one),|(either one)]

Conditional Statements
->if
->else
->if-else
->switch

Note : we can use teneray operator(?) instead of if else

-----
Scanner - helps to take dynamic values from user
->Scanner is in java.util [package]
->It has inbuilt methods
  ->nextInt() -> takes integer values
  ->next() -> takes next word
  ->nextDouble -> takes decimal values
  ->nextLine -> takes whole para
-------
looping Statements
-> for loop : known before iterations.
-> while : don't known before iterations.
-> do-while : excute atleast once.

jump Statements
->break : exist from looping Statements/
->continue : skip that particular Conditiona.
->return : return value to caller.

nested loops : loop inside other loop
--------

oops - object oriented programing language

class:
-> we Structure programs using data(characteristics) and behaviour(actions)
-> Anything in real world consider as Object ex: pen,laptop
-> blueprint on creating objects

method:
->behaviour(actions)
->Block of code perform some take

variable:
->represent data(memory location)

types of variable:
  ->instance variable
    instance -> object of a class
    instance variable -> variable associated with objects
    -> memory is allocated when obj is created
    -> can have deafault values no value is allocated
    ->store in heap area
    ->created inside the class outside the method
  ->local variable
    ->created inside the method / blocks /constructor
    ->used for tempory calculations
    ->once execution completed memory is cleared.
  ->Global/static variables
